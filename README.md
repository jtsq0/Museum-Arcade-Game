Video Game Design 1 (Group Project)
Our Arcade Game is going to be a very similar game to the classic Galaga.
	Concept:
		- Top-Down Side-Scrolling Endless Space Shooter using multiple weapons to defeat enemies
		- Waves of enemies leading into a boss after the end of a wave or a few waves.
		- First Run-through, involves enemies being hit by one weapon
		- Enemies can fly around, horde together, or potentially shoot back
		- Potential Final Version, some enemies can only be defeated by specific weapons
		- Score-based game
